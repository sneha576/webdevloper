        <h2>The Design Challenge</h2>
        <div class= "details" ><P> The design challenge involved rethinking the existing faAsade, improving the convoluted interior layout, and enriching each space with finely creafted materials. We were required to reuse the xisting footprint, while raising the top of ofundation walls to exceed new flood regulations. Innovative materials were used to produce an energy efficient themral envelope and contemporary yet contextuaally approprizte facedes. </P></div>
